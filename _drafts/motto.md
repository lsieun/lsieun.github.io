## Cognition

- Common sense is not a gift, it's a punishment. Because you have to deal with everyone who doesn't have it.

## Emotion

- You will continue to suffer if you have an emotional reaction to everything that is said to you.
  True power is sitting back and observing things with logic. True power is restraint.
  If words control you that means everyone else can control you. Breathe and allow things to pass.
- You may fall in love with the beauty of someone,
  but remember that finally you have to live with the character, not the beauty.

## History

- History isn't there for you to like or dislike.
  It's there for you to learn from it.
  If it offends you, that's even better, because then you're less likely to repeat it.
  It's not yours to erase or destroy.

## Life

- Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced. -- Soren Kierkegaard

## Money

- Money is numbers and numbers never end. If it takes money to be happy, your search for happiness will never end.
- We buy things we don't need with money we don't have to impress people we don't like.

## Self

- Accept yourself, love yourself, and keep moving forward.
  If you want to fly, you have to give up what weighs you down. -- Roy T. Bennett

- Your mind is your instrument. Learn to be It's master and not its slave.

How others see you is not important. How you see yourself is important.

Be careful who you help

Don't burn your opportunity,for a temporary comfort.

Learn to use opportunities

- 一、信息差：我知道，你不知道；
- 二、认知差：我懂的，你不懂；
- 三、执行差：你我都懂，你不做，我做；
- 四、竞争差：你我都做，但我做的比你好。
