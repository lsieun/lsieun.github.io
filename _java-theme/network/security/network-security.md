Central to most **security** related issues is **encryption**.
This is the process of converting information
that needs to be protected to an encrypted form using a key or a set of keys.
The receiver of the encrypted information can use a key or set of keys
to decrypt the information and revert it to its original form.
This technique will prevent unauthorized access to the information.

We will demonstrate the use of both **symmetric** and **asymmetric** encryption techniques.
**Symmetric encryption** uses a single key to encrypt and decrypt messages.
**Asymmetric encryption** uses a pair of keys.
These keys are frequently stored in a file called a **keystore**.
