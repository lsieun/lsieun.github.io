**Unix** lead to the development of the **GNU Project**
which needed a kernel that was supplied by **Linux** to produce the **GNU/Linux Operating System**.
`GNU/Linux` and `Unix` are generally criticised for being hard to use for the common user--all those command line tools
and all that fiddling with configurations puts it at odds with the demand is for modern intuitive interfaces
similar to those pioneered by the Macintosh back in 1984.

这段理解：

- （1） Unix，可能是由于”版权“的限制性，促进了 GNU Project 的发展。
- （2） GNU Project，刚开始只有 GNU Software， 而 `GNU/HURD` 作为 kernel 一直没有发展起来。
- （3） 后来，Linux 作为 kernel，与 GNU Software 一起，共同组成了 GNU/Linux Operating System。换句话说，GNU software + Linux Kernel = GNU/Linux Operating System
- （4） 但是，GNU/Linux 和 Unix 共同面临的问题是，对于 common user 来说，hard to use。

**Unix has had graphical user interfaces for a long time.
However, Unix vendors had difficulty agreeing on a common way of doing things like a graphical user interface**.
Systems such as NeWS, OpenWindows, Display PostScript, and the X Window System all had their days.
There was also a multitude of windowing systems available for the X Window System,
including CDE, Motif, OpenLook, and so on.
**With freedom and flexibility comes great diversity! And great confusion**.
Developers could chose different toolkits with different ways of interacting with applications,
leading to user confusion with activities as simple as moving to the next text field, keyboard shortcuts,
cut and paste, and so on.
**Apple**, with the Macintosh, by contrast controlled how things should be done and developed guidelines
for developers to do things the “right way.”
Later, **Microsoft** with Windows/95 and beyond also dictated standards for others to follow.
This meant that once the user had learnt the nuances of the interface they were “set for life.”

这段的理解：

- （1） Unix 对于 GUI 的功能早已经存在很长时间了，但是不同的 Unix 版本之间缺乏一个统一的标准。
- （2） 原因：自由和灵活性，增加了多样性，但同时，也带来了“选择的困惑”。
- （3） Apple 公司的 Macintosh 引导了 the “right way”
- （4） Microsoft 的 Windows 也提出了 standards

- nuance
    - （意义、声音、颜色、感情等方面的）细微差别 a very slight difference in meaning, sound, colour or sb's feelings that is not usually very obvious

- set for life
    - 某人这辈子有足够的钱用 someone who is set for life has so much money that they never need to work again

The **Gnome** Project pioneered by Miguel de Icaza in 1997 and
progressed by the free software company he founded with Nat Friedman in early 2000,
originally called HelixCode and then Ximian, set standards.
The traditional Unix players, including Sun Microsystems, IBM, Hewlett-Packard,
and Compaq joined the Gnome Foundation in August 2000 to help that standard become, well, standard.

**Gnome** is not the only standard though!
**KDE**, begun by Matthias Ettrich in 1996, is a very respectable and popular alternative.
KDE suffered in the early days of its development by being dependent on a toolkit, Qt,
that did not meet the licensing criteria for Free Software.
It was this one unfortunate blemish that lead to the development of the **Gnome** project.
The fact that there emerged **two standard desktops** is not a particular concern as the friendly
(but at times heated) competition drives the enthusiasts in both camps.
We do need to **learn though from the past** and **not allow this competition to destroy our common goals**.
Perhaps one will live on beyond the other, or, preferably, both will live on.
Either way, both are excellent products developing easier to use `GNU/Linux` systems, and leaving the choice to the user.

- blemish
    - 斑点；疤痕；瑕疵 a mark on the skin or on an object that spoils it and makes it look less beautiful or perfect
