He is best known as the author of `MINIX`,
a free Unix-like operating system for teaching purposes, and for his computer science textbooks,
regarded as standard texts in the field.
He regards his teaching job as his most important work.
Since 2004 he has operated Electoral-vote.com,
a website dedicated to analysis of polling data in federal elections in the United States.

## Biography

In 1944, Tanenbaum was born in New York City and grew up in suburban White Plains, New York. He is Jewish.

He received his bachelor of Science degree in Physics from MIT in 1965 and his Ph.D. degree in astrophysics
from the University of California, Berkeley in 1971.

In 1987, Tanenbaum wrote a clone of UNIX, called `MINIX` (MINi-unIX), for the IBM PC.
It was targeted at students and others who wanted to learn how an operating system worked.
Consequently, he wrote a book that listed the source code in an appendix and described it in detail in the text.
The source code itself was available on a set of floppy disks.
Within three months, a Usenet newsgroup, `comp.os.minix`,
had sprung up with over 40,000 subscribers discussing and improving the system.
One of these subscribers was a Finnish student named **Linus Torvalds**
who began adding new features to `MINIX` and tailoring it to his own needs.


He moved to the Netherlands to live with his wife, who is Dutch, but he retains his United States citizenship.
He teaches courses about Computer Organization and Operating Systems and supervises the work of Ph.D. candidates
at the VU University Amsterdam.

In the early 1990s, the Dutch government began setting up a number of thematically oriented research schools
that spanned multiple universities.
These schools were intended to bring professors and Ph.D. students from different Dutch (and later, foreign)
universities together to help them cooperate and enhance their research.

Tanenbaum was one of the cofounders and first Dean of the Advanced School for Computing and Imaging (ASCI).
This school initially consisted of nearly 200 faculty members and Ph.D. students from the Vrije Universiteit,
University of Amsterdam, Delft University of Technology, and Leiden University.
They were especially working on problems in advanced computer systems
such as parallel computing and image analysis and processing.

On October 5, 1991, **Torvalds** announced his own (`POSIX` like) kernel, called `Linux`,
which originally used the `MINIX` file system but is not based on MINIX code.
