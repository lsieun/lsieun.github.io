## Intro

The **GNU/Linux Operating System** is built on the **Linux kernel**.
To install `GNU/Linux` on your PC you could start with installing the **Linux kernel** and
then **compiling and installing the GNU tools and other essential software** that makes up the operating system.
This is not a trivial task and can require some sophisticcated computing skills.

这段理解：

- （1） 安装 GNU/Linux 需要两个过程：第一，安装 Linux kernel；第二，安装其他软件
- （2） 这个过程很复杂  --> Linux Distribution 来简化

However, we benefit greatly from the tremendous contributions many people have made
to ensure installing `GNU/Linux` is accessible to everyone.

Many people over many years have put a lot of effort into packaging things together into **Distributions**
so that **installing GNU/Linux is now straightforward**.
Distributions typically provide the whole system as a collection of packages
from which you can choose the packages to install to suite your own requirements.
Some packages are mandatory, and form the base installation.
Other packages are then installed as you need them.

总结：

- （1） Distributions 方便了安装 GNU/Linux 的过程。
- （2） Linux Distribution = Linux Kernel + 应用软件

Up front, our recommendation is to install the `Ubuntu` distribution,
which is based on `Debian GNU/Linux` and can come with vendor support from Canonical, though it is not a requirement.
For a resource limited machine (an older server with 1GB RAM or less, for example) then `Lubuntu` is recommended.
`Debian` is an excellent alternative choice.

## Distributions

`Red Hat` (now Fedora Core) is a good distribution and is quite popular for supported server-based environments
with a focus on **the commercial server market** rather than **the desktop user market**.

`Debian`, more so than most other distributions,
fundamentally conforms to the open and distributed development model,
making it a very open distribution where even you can make a change to it, if you so desired.
