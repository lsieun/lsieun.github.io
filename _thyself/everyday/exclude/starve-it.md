Alan Watts
1915-1973
英國哲學家、作家

The best way to end something is to starve it.
no reaction, just don't feed it.
That's where true power lays.
Where attention goes, energy flows.
And, when energetic patterns are broken, new worlds emerge, 
Don't return negative energy, 
Remove yourself and 
Create new algorithms.
```

Attention here means thinking, reflecting, talking about and interacting with someone/something.
```

```text
Sometimes, the loudest response is silence.
Starve the negativity, and you will see how fast it fades away.
```
