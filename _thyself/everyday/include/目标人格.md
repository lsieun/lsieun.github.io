## WWJD

```text
"What Would Jesus Do", often abbreviated as WWJD,
serves as a reminder to consider Jesus Christ's actions and teachings from the Gospels
when making decisions in their own lives.
This slogan encourages people to model their behavior on that of Jesus,
asking themselves how Jesus would respond in their situation.
