Why is it that
those who are called to a higher purpose
often face the deepest battles with lust?
It's a struggle that
no one likes to talk about.

Yet it's more common than you think and
the reasons behind it are shocking.
```

```text
If you're feeling overwhelmed by this silent battle
you're not alone.
In fact there's a Biblical explanation for it.
Let's uncover the truth behind this hidden struggle.

Throughout the Bible
some of the most anointed people
faced Fierce Temptations.

Think of King David
a man after God's Own Heart
who fell into the Trap of lust with Bathsheba
or Samson
whose strength and calling were
overshadowed by his weakness for Delilah
```

```text
Even today those chosen by God are not
exempt from this struggle,
but why?

Why does lust seem to Target those set apart for greatness
It's not just about human weakness,
it's a spiritual battle and
the enemy knows exactly who to Target.

The Bible makes it clear that
spiritual warfare is real.
Ephesians 6:12 says
For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood
but against principalities,
against Powers,
against the rulers of the darkness of this age,
against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the Heavenly places.
```

简而言之，
"war" 更加宏观，强调的是整个冲突事件；
而 "warfare" 则更加微观，关注的是如何进行战斗的具体方法和策略。
两者在某些语境下可能会有重叠，但在大多数情况下，它们各自有着明确的应用范围。

principality
王公治理的国家；公国；侯国a country that is ruled by a prince

Lust isn't just a physical Temptation
it's a spiritual attack aimed at those with a Divine calling.
The enemy knows that
if he can corrupt the purity of a chosen one
he can hinder God's purpose for their life.

But why does this struggle hit so hard
Here are 5 shocking reasons
```

```text
1. Spiritual Sensitivity makes Temptation Stronger

Being spiritually Gifted
often means having heightened awareness,
not just of God's presence,
but also of the enemy's tactics.

Lust is a powerful tool
the enemy uses to distract
and weaken those with Divine callings.

Chosen ones often experience more
intense Temptations
because the enemy knows that
if he can trap them in lust
he can slow down or even derail their spiritual growth.
```

derail: （使）脱轨，出轨 to leave the track; to make a train do this
```

2. Isolation leads to Hidden Battles

Chosen ones are often set apart,
walking a path that few can understand.
While this Solitude can be a blessing,
it also creates a dangerous vulnerability.

Without strong accountability or deep spiritual connections,
lust becomes a private struggle.
 
The secrecy of this battle
makes it harder to overcome
leading many chosen ones to suffer in silence.
```

```text
3. High Calling attracts Greater Attacks

The higher the calling,
the stronger the Warfare.

Lust isn't just a natural human struggle,
it is a spiritual attack
designed to keep chosen ones distracted
drained and distanced from God.

Many great leaders, prophets and spiritual Warriors
have fallen
because they underestimated the power of this battle.

The enemy uses lust as a constant snare,
knowing that even the strongest Warriors
can be brought down by their flesh.
```

```text
4. Emotional Wounds create Open Doors

Many chosen ones carry deep emotional wounds
rejection, abandonment, past heartbreaks
these unhealed scars can
become open doors for lust.

When a person is emotionally vulnerable
the enemy offers lust as a false Comfort,
a counterfeit connection to fill the void.

Without inner healing,
lust becomes a coping mechanism,
creating a cycle of sin and shame
that is is hard to break.
```





```text
5. Strong Spiritual Gifts come with a Weak Flesh

Many chosen ones have powerful spiritual gifts,
but they are still human.
The flesh remains weak,
and without consistent spiritual discipline,
prayer, fasting and renewing the mind
the battle against lust intensifies.

The greater the anointing
the greater the need for self-control.
Without actively strengthening their Spirit,
chosen ones can easily find themselves falling into
patterns of lustful thoughts and actions.
```

```text
Lust is a battle that
many chosen ones face in secret,
but Victory is possible.
Through spiritual discipline,
accountability, and healing,
they can overcome this struggle
and continue walking in their Divine Purpose.

The enemy's goal is to keep them trapped,
but God's power is always greater.
The question is
will they fight or will they fall?

拔示巴（Bathsheba），是《圣经》中的一个重要的美女，
她原来是大卫下属乌利亚的妻子。
有一次大卫在房顶上行走，看到拔示巴在裸体洗澡，
他就爱上了美丽的拔示巴，诱奸拔示巴怀孕后，
大卫借故杀死了拔示巴的丈夫乌利亚。
上帝惩罚大卫，刀剑永远不离开他的家并杀死了他们通奸而生的长子。
在拔示巴成为了大卫的妃嫔后，
又为大卫生了一个孩子，他们的孩子就是著名的所罗门王。

参孙和达莉拉 Samson and Delilah

公元前，希伯莱（以色列）百姓遭到异教徒腓力斯人的蹂躏，深受暴政之苦。
他们认为这可能是被希伯莱之神耶和华（上帝）抛弃的缘故。
然而希伯莱青年参孙却不这样认为，因为他发现自己勇敢刚毅且力大无比，举世无双。
参孙认为希伯莱民众整天忧愁哀叹是根本摆脱不了被奴役的命运，
只有大家团结起来和敌人斗争才能获得最终的自由。
于是在参孙的带领下，希伯莱人打败了腓力斯人重新获得了自由的生活。
腓力斯人不甘自己的失败，但又无法抗拒参孙的神力，
于是他们绞尽脑汁，企图以美人计的方式来获得参孙力量源泉的秘密，并置他于死地。
腓力斯少女达丽拉美貌绝伦，她以自己的绝世美色使得参孙一见倾心。
在两人爱情缠绵的时候，达丽拉诱使参孙最终说出了他力量所在的秘密——来自上帝赐予他的一缕头发。
随后，达丽拉便趁参孙熟睡之时，剪去了参孙赋有魔法的头发，使他彻底丧失了力量，成为腓力斯人的阶下囚。

失去魔力的参孙，被腓力斯人剜去双眼，投放在磨房里推磨。
不久，在腓力斯人的祭祖盛典中，参孙又被拉入神殿受尽了百般的侮辱。
痛苦万分的参孙在巨大精神的折磨中向上帝默默忏悔，并暗暗祈祷，
希望上帝能够给他一次悔过自新的机会，同时也希望能再次赋予他神奇的力量。
就在腓力斯人纵酒狂欢庆贺破解参孙魔力的时候，
被绑在腓力斯神殿石柱上的参孙突然感到浑身又在逐渐地充满了力量，
他知道，这是上帝宽恕了他，并使他重新获得力量。
就在腓力斯人狂欢至热烈的顶点之时，重新获得神力的参孙使出了全力，
猛然推倒了巨大的神殿，自己则与这三千敌人同归于尽。
