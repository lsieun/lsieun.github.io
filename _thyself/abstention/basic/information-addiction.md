Have you ever heard of information addiction
it might be a new term for you
but the behavior is something
you've definitely seen around

Let me explain with a scenario
picture this
Arun is an IT professional like many of us
Arun starts his day by reaching for his phone
he Scrolls through social media even
takes his phone to the restroom
then it's email WhatsApp
and he's on his way to work
at work he's still scrolling
unable to focus
during lunch he's checking the news
and the cycle continues all day
finally he comes home starts to watch news and reels while eating
and even when he's exhausted
he Scrolls through his phone
until he passes out

sounds familiar right
it's a common story these days in our daily lives
we are constantly consuming information
either actively or passively

But what's the difference?

Active consumption is when you seek information
that you need or you're interested in
for instance if Arun searches for
information on artificial intelligence to upskill
that's active consumption

Passive consumption on the other hand is
when you stumble upon information
without looking for it
like when you are mindlessly scrolling through social media

Now you might think
what's wrong with knowing more?
Isn't it good to stay informed up to date
Here's the catch
Imagine Arun who is passionate about AI
he schedules time to learn about it
searches for videos and intentionally
watches content to improve his skills
that's intentional use of the internet
it is absolutely healthy
but if he's constantly uncontrollably scrolling
through AI content all day
disrupting his work personal life
and even simple daily chores
that's unhealthy
there is a danger that
he will become addicted to information

Why is this a problem?
Let's dive into some brain signs
when you engage in an activity that interests you
it triggers your brain's reward system
releasing dopamine which makes you feel good
this is not just limited to alcohol or drugs
you can even become addicted to information
that excites you
think about it
why do we binge watch movies and TV shows
it's to get effortless dopamine hit, right?
The same goes for consuming News, Articles and YouTube videos
even if the content is valuable
it can still give you that addictive dopamine hit

When consumed in large quantities
even good things can be harmful
When you overwork physically your body gets tired
and it will demand rest
but when you over consume information and
if your brain gets that dopamine hit from
engaging content it wants to keep going
it will make you repeat the activity
over and over again

Today's digital world makes information more accessible than ever
we have the internet social media and 24/7 news Cycles at our fingertips
but this constant flow of information
has created a compulsive
need to stay connected and informed
often at the expense of our well-being

It is designed to get us hooked and addicted
because of it,
your mental health and overall well-being are at stake

constant information overload can lead to
increase stress anxiety and even depression
it can decrease your focus and productivity
it will make it harder to complete tasks and enjoy life

Information feeds us with a desire to
consume more information
This habit has the potential to become an addiction

information addiction is an uncontrollable urge to
consume information negatively
even though it impacts Productivity Mental Health and
relationships

How can you escape from information addiction?
We scroll endlessly
because we consume content without a purpose
whether it's for education or entertainment
Your consumption should be intentional
Have a purpose
Set a time limit
Consume the necessary content
Practice intentional consumption
